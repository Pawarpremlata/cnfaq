1.What is data link layer?
Data Link Layer is second layer of OSI Layered Model. Data link layer is responsible for converting data stream to signals bit by bit and to send that over the underlying hardware.

2.Functions of data link layer
1.framing
2.addressing
3.synchronization
4.error control
5.flow control 
6.multi-access

Tyes of errors
single bit error:In a frame, there is only one bit, anywhere though, which is corrupt.
Multiple bits error:Frame is received with more than one bits in corrupted state.
Burst error:Frame contains more than1 consecutive bits corrupted.

What are the error control mechanism?
1.error detection
2.error correction

Write the four Error-Correcting Codes?
1.Hamming codes
2.Binary convolutional codes
3.Reed-Solomon codes
4.Low-Density Parity Check codes.
